# Universal Editor Extension - Custom Asset Picker

This is an extension of Universal Editor for picking AEM assets in different repositories than the one used by the editted page.

## Setup

- Populate the `.env` file in the project root and fill it as shown [below](#env)

## Local Dev

- `aio app run` to start your local Dev server
- App will run on `localhost:9080` by default

By default the UI will be served locally but actions will be deployed and served from Adobe I/O Runtime. To start a
local serverless stack and also run your actions locally use the `aio app run --local` option.

## Test & Coverage

- Run `aio app test` to run unit tests for ui and actions
- Run `aio app test --e2e` to run e2e tests

## Deploy & Cleanup

- `aio app deploy` to build and deploy all actions on Runtime and static files to CDN
- `aio app undeploy` to undeploy the app

## Config

### `.env`

You can generate this file using the command `aio app use`. 

```bash
# This file must **not** be committed to source control

## Adobe I/O Runtime credentials
AIO_runtime_auth=
AIO_runtime_namespace=
AIO_runtime_apihost=https://adobeioruntime.net
```

### `app.config.yaml`

- Main configuration file that defines an application's implementation. 
- More information on this file, application configuration, and extension configuration 
  can be found [here](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/appbuilder-configuration/#appconfigyaml)

#### Action Dependencies

- You have two options to resolve your actions' dependencies:

  1. **Packaged action file**: Add your action's dependencies to the root
   `package.json` and install them using `npm install`. Then set the `function`
   field in `app.config.yaml` to point to the **entry file** of your action
   folder. We will use `webpack` to package your code and dependencies into a
   single minified js file. The action will then be deployed as a single file.
   Use this method if you want to reduce the size of your actions.

  2. **Zipped action folder**: In the folder containing the action code add a
     `package.json` with the action's dependencies. Then set the `function`
     field in `app.config.yaml` to point to the **folder** of that action. We will
     install the required dependencies within that directory and zip the folder
     before deploying it as a zipped action. Use this method if you want to keep
     your action's dependencies separated.

## Customize the extension

This extension assumes you have a component type `custom-asset` in your page component model, which is mapped to the custom field extension. You can edit it in [the extension registration file](src/aem-uex-1/web-src/components/ExtensionRegistration.js) to map a different component type, or add more extensions to Universal Editor.

## Typescript support for UI

To use typescript use `.tsx` extension for react components and add a `tsconfig.json` 
and make sure you have the below config added
```
 {
  "compilerOptions": {
      "jsx": "react"
    }
  } 
```
